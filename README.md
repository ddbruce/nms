News Management System
======================

Overview
--------
Originally designed for the school newspaper at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Polytechnic NMS is a content management system tailored for media organizations. 

Features
--------
+ Organizations - assign positions and control which members upload content
+ News Sections - shown on the site's navigation bar, used for sorting articles into unique categories, and can be changed at any time
+ Admin Dashboard - control media uploads, article lists, section headings, organizations, users, and more
+ Media Uploads - currently supports photo uploads that can be attached to articles. Future media types will include InDesign XML file uploads that can be parsed into ready-to-go articles for an easier workflow. 
+ Article Creation - Easily create and submit articles through our own article submission process 


Future Plans
------------
This application should be adaptable for any small media organization, therefore, the plan is to support various customization features. Among these features are image uploads for the website banner, editable links for social media sharing, and custom CSS variables through the admin panel.

The long term goal is to create a simple and useful solution maintaining any school news organization's web prescence.
