A new, Rails-based website for The Rensselaer Polytechnic, the newspaper at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.

This site is a project of the Web Technologies Group, an agency of the Rensselaer Student Senate. The work is done through the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software, also known as RCOS, by Editor in Chief Dan Bruce '16 and Web Tech Chairman Gabe Perez '16.

More will be put in the readme at a later date.
